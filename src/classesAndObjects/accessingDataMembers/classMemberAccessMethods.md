Accessing data members of a class allows you to retrieve or modify the attributes or
properties associated with an instance of that class. Data members store the state
of an object, and accessing them is crucial for performing operations, making the
class dynamic, and interacting with the object's internal data.

> Here's a list of different ways to access data members and member functions of a class:

- **Direct Access (Public Members)**
- **Accessing Private Members through Public Member Functions**
- **Friend Function**
